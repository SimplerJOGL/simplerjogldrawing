This Logo-style drawing environment is designed to be an introduction to Java programming for total novices. It is built on top of [SimplerJOGL](http://simplerjogl.googlecode.com), with the idea that the first semester of programming will slowly dig deeper and deeper into this code (and thence SimplerJOGL), culminating with object-oriented OpenGL programming using the [JOGL](http://jogamp.com/jogl) binding for the [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org) library.
